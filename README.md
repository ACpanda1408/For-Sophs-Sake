# For-Sophs-Sake
Crazy birthday present, I feel like you would unfriend me but u wouldn't dare. Enjoy the cringe!
(attempting to read the md docs to get a grip)
## OK so the whole process
Can i just rant about how annoying the keyboard is being first of all? It didn't like it when I typed # so every time it just turned into pound, I live in Britain but I don't exactly need my computer to not give me a hashtag when it clearly says hashtag on the keyboard
anyways breathhhhhh 
### Inspiration

From the duck or Llama game was the first thingy that sprang into my mind, I was just sitting there waiting for a certain someone to finish their shopping and got pretty bored so I simply went on the app and boom ideas
Basically a little spice was added and made it slightly more like cringe material

## First day 
Pretty much just speedran the whole game ngl, just got home from a long trip and sat in my bed replicating the duck game. Took a while with all the javascript n stylin but overall really fun!
Js was being annoying when it refused to stop firing event listeners, one fires and doesn't stop the other ugh u don't wanna know

## Day two 
Added a bit of a twist to it with this as the reference:

it semi worked and the design that turned out was like this

The whole concept works, me being a perfectionist decided to add features, many many features but my lazy ass brain decided not to do that much because it's quite annoying and actually has a high risk of it dying on me every second of the day
So for those features i'm leaving it for another time: maybe there could be a version 2.0 - there will be no leaks be patient

## Experiences and what I (supposedly) learnt in this project
- Genuinely had so much fun making this, it made me lose myself in coding once again 11 out of 10 for the coding experience
- Link shorteners don't actually work, images don't appear because the link shortening websites put some kind of time limit
- don't over complicate :D
